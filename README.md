# Space Biology Knowledge Engine  
### Victorious Secrets — NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025

## Overview  
**Space Biology Knowledge Engine** is a web-based platform designed to simplify and accelerate access to space biology research data. Our project focuses on improving the **quality of life for astronauts and researchers** by enabling intuitive exploration, search, visualization, and analysis of biological datasets from spaceflight experiments. It aggregates curated data and provides powerful query capabilities, AI-driven summaries, and collaboration tools — all in a user-friendly interface.

## Problem Statement  
Space biology research produces vast amounts of complex data scattered across different sources. Researchers often spend significant time cleaning, combining, and understanding this data before they can derive meaningful insights. This delays innovation and hinders the rapid advancement of life sciences in space exploration.

Our solution aims to **bridge this gap** by building a centralized knowledge engine that offers accessible, searchable, and insightful data with enhanced usability features.
